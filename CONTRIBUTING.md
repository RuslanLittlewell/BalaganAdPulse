# Contributing

## Language

Everything in this repository is written in English: code, identifiers, comments,
documentation, commit messages and API error messages.

## Commit messages

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

```
type(scope): subject

optional body

optional footer
```

### Types

| Type | Use for |
|------|---------|
| `feat` | New functionality exposed to API consumers |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation only — README, specs, plans, this file |
| `test` | Adding or reworking tests without touching production code |
| `refactor` | Code change that neither adds behaviour nor fixes a bug |
| `perf` | Performance improvement |
| `build` | Build system and dependencies — `package.json`, `tsconfig`, `Dockerfile` |
| `ci` | CI/CD configuration |
| `chore` | Maintenance that fits nothing else — `.gitignore`, editor config |
| `revert` | Reverting a previous commit |
| `style` | Formatting with no effect on meaning |

Pick the type by the *intent* of the change, not by the file extension. A test added
as part of a new endpoint belongs to that endpoint's `feat` commit; `test` is for
commits whose whole point is test coverage.

### Scope

Optional, lowercase, names the affected area: `api`, `clients`, `db`, `docker`,
`deps`, later `web`. Omit it when the change is repository-wide.

### Subject

- Imperative mood — `add`, not `added` or `adds`
- Lowercase first letter, no trailing period
- 72 characters or fewer
- Describe the change, not the file you edited

```
feat(clients): add pagination to the list endpoint
fix(clients): reject negative monthlyBudget on update
docs: add commit conventions
build(deps): upgrade prisma to 6.19
chore: add gitignore
```

Avoid:

```
Added gitignore                   # past tense, capitalized, no type
fix: bug                          # says nothing
feat: update client.service.ts    # names the file, not the change
```

### Body and footer

Separate the body from the subject with a blank line and wrap it at 72 characters.
Explain *why* the change was made — the diff already shows *what* changed.

Footers:

```
BREAKING CHANGE: monthlyBudget is now returned as a string
Refs: #12
```

A breaking change may also be marked with `!` after the type: `feat(api)!: ...`.

## Splitting work into commits

Each commit should leave the repository in a compiling state and tell one story.
Practical guidance for this project:

- Move bottom-up through the dependency graph — schema, then service, then the HTTP
  layer — so no commit references a module that does not exist yet.
- Keep a module's tests in the same commit as the module they cover.
- Keep unrelated changes apart: a dependency bump and a bug fix are two commits.

## Before committing

Start the database and run the suite from the repository root:

```bash
docker compose up -d db
npm test
```

Tests must be green. Tests are written before the implementation for each slice —
see the plan documents in [docs/superpowers/plans/](docs/superpowers/plans/).

## Specs and plans

Every phase gets its own design document in
[docs/superpowers/specs/](docs/superpowers/specs/) and an implementation plan in
[docs/superpowers/plans/](docs/superpowers/plans/), named `YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`.
Write and approve the spec before touching code.
